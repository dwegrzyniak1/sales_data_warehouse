# Sales Data Warehouse Project
### Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a mini Sales Data Warehouse using Python, pandas, and PostgreSQL. The goal is to create a star schema data model with fact and dimension tables, load sales data into the database, and run analytical SQL queries.

### Features
Data extraction and transformation with Python and pandas

Star schema modeling (fact and dimension tables)

Loading data into PostgreSQL database

SQL queries to analyze sales data (e.g., top customers, best-selling products)

### Dataset
The sales dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: Sales Dataset. It contains transactional sales records including customer, product, order, and payment details (ttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanugarg274/sales-dataset)
